Task 2 â€“ Phishing Email Analysis

Description

Phishing emails are deceptive messages sent by attackers to trick users into giving up confidential information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or login credentials.

The goal of this task was to:
Identify phishing traits in a suspicious email.
Analyze its email header using online tools.
Understand the tactics used by attackers to deceive users.

Document the findings in a structured and security-aware format.
